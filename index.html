            <h1 class="mx-5 mt-5 text-center text-white fst-italic bg-danger w-25"> OUR STORY </h1>
            <p class="my-5 mx-5 text-white w-50"> The Hezekiah Foundation is centered around Hezekiah Kudayisi, who suffered from a stroke on the night of April 28th, 2010.
                He loved his grandchildren very much and was the true definition of a charitable giver.
                The Hezekiah Foundation started when his granddaughter, Joy Morounfolu, decided that dedicating the foundation to her grandfather was the best way to commemorate his memory.
                <br><br>

                What started out as small volunteering acts of services turned into this foundation, in his honor.
                Although Joy Morounfolu was still an undergraduate student at the start of the foundation, she did not let anything derail her from making sure everything was a success. </p>

            <h1 class="mx-5 mt-5 text-center text-white fst-italic bg-danger w-50"> WHO WAS HEZEKIAH? </h1>
            <p class="my-5 mx-5 text-white w-50"> The late Pa Hezekiah Oladunjoye Kudayisi, known as H.O.K. by friends and family, was born February 2nd, 1927 in Adeleye village via Ibara Orile, Ogun State, Nigeria.
                H.O.K was farming with his father in Abiodun village Araromi, Ibese for a period of 12 years without schooling because there was practically no school around until 1939.
                In 1939, a primary school very close to Ibese was established, United Primary School.
                Hezekiah was essentially loved by all his teachers because he knew how to keep school surroundings clean and would plant trees to beautify the school premises.
                Young Hezekiah in a quest for a better school left United primary school in 1944 for Anglican Primary School, Igbore Abeokuta, where he continued his primary education.
                At this new school, his teacher popularly known as "Aro Baba" (very strict) was in charge of script and cursive writing and loved him because he was very good at the subjects.
                Pa Hezekiah sought admission into "Thomas Marshall college of commerce" Idi Ayunre, Ibadan, where he studied commerce and majored extensively in shorthand and typing. He graduated from the college in 1954.

                <br><br>

                Pa Hezekiah Oladunjoye Kudayisi worked in several places. His first place of work was Odutola Tyres and Sons in Ibadan (1954). He later moved to another job as a clerk in Baptist Bookshop, Oke-Bola, Ibadan (1957).
                Pa Kudayisi, worked in several other places which include YMCA, in Ibadan, as a cocoa sales boy and trainer, and John Holt to mention a few. H.O.K. retired as a Chief Typist/Confidential Secretary in 1984 in Ogun State Housing Corporation Abeokuta after 35 years of distinguished and meritorious service.

                <br><br>

                Pa Hezekiah Oladunjoye Kudayisi got married to his amiable wife, Mama Esther Wuraola Kudayisi (Nee Olude) in 1960, from a ruling family in Imasai.
                They were indeed, one flesh and inseparable when he was alive. He was blessed with distinguished children and grandchildren.
                Hezekiah was a staunch member of Young Men Christian Association (YMCA) in St. Andrews Anglican Church, Ibara, Abeokuta for many years, where he contributed his quota immensely before his demise.
                In special recognition of his sacrificial love and fatherly care to God's vineyard, a Meritorious Award was presented to Papa H.O.K. on the 25th January 2009 by St. Paul's Anglican Church, llewo Orile (Diocese of Yewa).
                His soul is undoubtedly rejoicing before God, His Maker, and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, honor, and dominion forever and ever, for giving us such a wonderful amiable personality as Papa Hezekiah Oladunjoye Kudayisi.
